# To prove two numbers are equal

Let $m$ and $n$ be some numbers. Then:

$$
m = n \iff m \leq n \ \land \ m \geq n
$$

# Adding zero to an expression

When stuck, add *zero*. Example from [[metric spaces]] for triangle inequality in *Example a)*:

$$
\begin{gather}
\textcolor{green}{d(x,y)} = |x - y| = |x \textcolor{red}{- z + z} - y| = |x-z|+|z-y|= \textcolor{green}{d(x,z)+d(z,y)} \\ \\
\implies d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)
\end{gather}
$$

Very handy.
