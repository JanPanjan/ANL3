# The completeness principle

Every nonempty subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is **bounded above** has a **least upper bound**. Its called the **supremum**, denoted by $sup A$.

> If $A$ is not bounded above, we can write $sup A = \infty$.

Every nonempty subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ that is **bounded bellow** has a **greatest lower bound**. Its called the **infimum**, denoted by $inf A$.

> If $A$ is not bounded below, we can write $inf A = - \infty$.
