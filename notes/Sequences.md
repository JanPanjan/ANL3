A sequence $\{a_{n}\}$ of $\mathbb{R}$ numbers is

- **increasing** if $a_{n+1} \geq a_{n}$
- **decreasing** if $a_{n+1} \leq a_{n}$

A sequence is **monotone** if it's either increasing or decreasing.

The sequence $\{a_{n}\}$ is **bounded** if $\exists M \in \mathbb{R}$, such that $|a_{n}| < M$

> It has limited size, it's *finite*.
