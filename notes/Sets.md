# Power of a set

Number of elements in a subset is always smaller than set it is part of. 

$$
\begin{align}
A \subseteq A' &\implies |A| \leq |A'| \\ \\
A \subseteq B \cup C &\implies |A| \leq |B| \cup |C| \\ \\
A \subseteq B \cap C &\implies |A| \leq |B| \cap |C|
\end{align}
$$


Power of a union.

$$
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
$$

Consequently:

$$
|A \cup B| \leq |A| + |B| \implies |A \cap B| \geq 0
$$
